Python Chess programs
This is my first chess program. I am using the chess python libraries and python 3.7.
The newchess.py uses random selection over legal moves. Because of this it gets "smarter"
as the number of pieces shrink. It handles check well as the legal moves limits its choices.
It plays a very odd game with it seemly resisting you but seldom taking your pieces.
