# Python Chess programs
This is my repo for python chess programs. I am using the chess python libraries and python 3.7.
## Chess Library
I am using the chess library that is supported from here [Chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess).
## newchess.py
The newchess.py uses random selection over legal moves. Because of this it gets "smarter"
as the number of pieces shrink. It handles check well as the legal moves limits its choices.
It plays a very odd game with it seemly resisting you but seldom taking your pieces.
